<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>This somewhat unpleasant tale, published as a novelette in the "Smart Set" in July, 1920, relates a series of events which took place in the spring of the previous year. Each of the three events made a great impression upon me. In life they were unrelated, except by the general hysteria of that spring which inaugurated the Age of Jazz, but in my story I have tried, unsuccessfully I fear, to weave them into a patternâ€”a pattern which would give the effect of those months in New York as they appeared to at least one member of what was then the younger generation.</p></div> </div>
