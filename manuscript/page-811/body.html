Swift mountain streams flowed rapidly up and down the mountains.</p><p>Jemima Tantrum was down at the stream, brewing whiskey at the family still.</p><p>She was a typical mountain girl.</p><p>Her feet were bare. Her hands, large and powerful, hung down below her knees. Her face showed the ravages of work. Although but sixteen, she had for over a dozen years been supporting her aged pappy and mappy by brewing mountain whiskey. From time to time she would pause in her task, and, filling a dipper full of the pure, invigorating liquid, would drain it offâ€”then pursue her work with renewed vigor.</p></div> </div>
