<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>So gaily and noisily were the peace and prosperity impending hymned by the scribes and poets of the conquering people that more and more spenders had gathered from the provinces to drink the wine of excitement, and faster and faster did the merchants dispose of their trinkets and slippers until they sent up a mighty cry for more trinkets and more slippers in order that they might give in barter what was demanded of them. Some even of them flung up their hands helplessly, shouting:</p><p>"Alas! I have no more slippers! and alas! I have no more trinkets! May heaven help me for I know not what I shall do!"</p><p>But no one listened to their great outcry, for the throngs were far too busyâ€”day by day, the foot-soldiers trod jauntily the highway and all exulted because the young men returning were pure and brave, sound of tooth and pink of cheek, and the young women of the land were virgins and comely both of face and of figure.</p></div> </div>
