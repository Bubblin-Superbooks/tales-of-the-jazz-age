Who are you?" burst out Mr. Button frantically.</p><p>"I can't tell you exactly who I am," replied the querulous whine, "because I've only been born a few hoursâ€”but my last name is certainly Button."</p><p>"You lie! You're an impostor!"</p><p>The old man turned wearily to the nurse. "Nice way to welcome a new-born child," he complained in a weak voice. "Tell him he's wrong, why don't you?"</p><p>"You're wrong. Mr. Button," said the nurse severely. "This is your child, and you'll have to make the best of it. We're going to ask you to take him home with you as soon as possible-some time to-day."</p></div> </div>
