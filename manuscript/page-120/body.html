At first glance he appeared to consist entirely of a very gaunt, cadaverous head and a sizable hump, but on being spread out he was found to possess a dark brown, unwholesome-looking body made of thick, cottony cloth.</p><p>"You see it takes two people," explained Mrs. Nolak, holding the camel in frank admiration.
