<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Hello, Jim."</p><p>It was a voice at his elbow—Joe Ewing sitting in an automobile with Marylyn Wade. Nancy Lamar and a strange man were in the back seat.</p><p>The Jelly-bean tipped his hat quickly.</p><p>"Hi Ben—" then, after an almost imperceptible pause—"How y' all?"</p><p>Passing, he ambled on toward the garage where he had a room up-stairs. His "How y'all" had been said to Nancy Lamar, to whom he had not spoken in fifteen years.</p><p>Nancy had a mouth like a remembered kiss and shadowy eyes and blue-black hair inherited from her mother who had been born in Budapest. Jim passed her often on the street, walking small-boy fashion with her hands in her pockets and he knew that with her inseparable Sally Carrol Hopper she had left a trail of broken hearts from Atlanta to New Orleans.</p></div> </div>
