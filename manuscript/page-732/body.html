There were two tables, and a good proportion of the young wives were smoking and shouting their bets, and being very daringly mannish for those days.</p><p>Roxanne had left the game early and taken to perambulation; she wandered into the pantry and found herself some grape juice—beer gave her a headache—and then passed from table to table, looking over shoulders at the hands, keeping an eye on Jeffrey and being pleasantly unexcited and content.</p></div> </div>
