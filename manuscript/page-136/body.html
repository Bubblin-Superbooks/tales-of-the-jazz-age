<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Mrs. Tate was standing just inside tie ballroom, following Millicent round with her eyes, and beaming whenever she caught her bye. Beside her were two middle-aged sycophants, who were saying what a perfectly exquisite child Millicent was. It was at this moment that Mrs. Tate was grasped firmly by the skirt and her youngest daughter, Emily, aged eleven, hurled herself with an "Oof!" into her mother's arms.</p><p>"Why, Emily, what's the trouble?"</p><p>"Mamma," said Emily, wild-eyed but voluble, "there's something out on the stairs."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>"There's a thing out on the stairs, mamma. I think it's a big dog, mamma, but it doesn't look like a dog."</p></div> </div>
