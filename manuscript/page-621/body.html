<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Caroline was a very young and gay person who lived with some older lady and was possibly nineteen. She was like a ghost in that she never existed until evening. She sprang into life when the lights went on in her apartment at about six, and she disappeared, at the latest, about midnight. Her apartment was a nice one, in a nice building with a white stone front, opposite the south side of Central Park. The back of her apartment faced the single window of the single room occupied by the single Mr. Grainger.</p><p>He called her Caroline because there was a picture that looked like her on the jacket of a book of that name down at the Moonlight Quill.</p></div> </div>
