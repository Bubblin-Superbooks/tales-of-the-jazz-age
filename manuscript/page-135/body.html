<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The Howard Tates are, as every one who lives in Toledo knows, the most formidable people in town. Mrs. Howard Tate was a Chicago Todd before she became a Toledo Tate, and the family generally affect that conscious simplicity which has begun to be the earmark of American aristocracy. The Tates have reached the stage where they talk about pigs and farms and look at you icy-eyed if you are not amused. They have begun to prefer retainers rather than friends as dinner guests, spend a lot of money in a quiet way, and, having lost all sense of competition, are in process of growing quite dull.</p><p>The dance this evening was for little Millicent Tate, and though all ages were represented, the dancers were mostly from school and collegeâ€”the younger married crowd was at the Townsends' circus ball up at the Tallyho Club.</p></div> </div>
