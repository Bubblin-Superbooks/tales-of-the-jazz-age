They were drugged while they were asleep—and their families were always told that they died of scarlet fever in Butte."</p><p>"But—I fail to understand why you kept on inviting them!"</p><p>"I didn't," burst out Kismine. "I never invited one. Jasmine did. And they always had a very good time. She'd give them the nicest presents toward the last. I shall probably have visitors too—I'll harden up to it. We can't let such an inevitable thing as death stand in the way of enjoying life while we have it. Think of how lonesome it'd be out here if we never had any one. Why, father and mother have sacrificed some of their best friends just as we have."</p></div> </div>
